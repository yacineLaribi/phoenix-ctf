*first rule*
We add clues as much as needed , so we need multiple servers and a team to watch the servers all day

*second rule*
There are Clues everywhere in the event even in the decoration

*third rule*
We are going to add mini games and challenges to give them **extra** hints

*fourth rule*
Thre clues that appears automatically when you hit a certain score **for example** when you hit 20 score appears a notification
that contains a hint says : "Check the logos" and the logo names contains a hint about the second flag


*last rule*
In case the time almost done , we add clues in the comments
and add this line of code to the `base.html` file 
				<div style="position: absolute;top:50%; right:50%;transform:translate(60%,-50%);">USERS CHECK THE COMMENTS OF THE FIRST POSTS</div>
add it just before the telehack logo element
